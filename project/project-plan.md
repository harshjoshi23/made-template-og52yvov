# Project Plan: Impact of COVID-19 on Correctional Facilities in the Americas

## 1. Introduction
The purpose of this project is to analyze the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on correctional facilities across North America, with a focus on infection rates, management responses, and the resulting impacts on inmate populations.

## 2. Data Sources
- **Facilities.csv**: Details on individual facilities including inmate counts and COVID-19 statistics.
- **Systems.csv**: Aggregated COVID-19 impact data on the state correctional system level.
- **NY Times COVID-19 Data**: Daily updates on COVID-19 cases and deaths, useful for comparative analysis with the general population.

## 3. Research Questions
- How do infection and mortality rates in correctional facilities compare to the general population?
- What facility characteristics correlate with higher COVID-19 morbidity and mortality?

## 4. Methodology
- **Data Cleaning**: Standardize data formats and handle missing data.
- **Data Analysis**: Statistical analysis and geospatial mapping of COVID-19 data across facilities.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Develop models to predict potential future outbreaks based on current data.

## 5. Technical Implementation
- **Tools**: Python, Jupyter Notebook.
- **Libraries**: Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.

## 6. Work Packages
- [Issue #1](link-to-issue): Data Cleaning
- [Issue #2](link-to-issue): Data Analysis Setup
- [Issue #3](link-to-issue): Report Drafting

## 7. Timeline
- **November**: Setup and initial data exploration.
- **December**: In-depth analysis and start of model development.
- **January**: Final analysis, modeling, and drafting of the report.

## 8. Challenges and Risk Management
- **Data Inconsistency**: Frequent updates and changes to data collection methodology could affect longitudinal analysis.
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Regular data validation checks and update logs.

## 9. Appendices and References
- Additional supporting documents or data sources.
